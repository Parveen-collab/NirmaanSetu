# NirmaanSetu
NirmaanSetu is a minimal, freshly initialized **Next.js** application.

## Core Technologies
- **Framework**: `Next.js 16.1.1` (App Router)
- **Library**: `React 19.2.3`
- **Language**: `TypeScript`
- **Styling**: `Tailwind CSS 4` with `PostCSS`
- **Fonts**: `Geist` and `Geist Mono` (integrated via `next/font`)

## Directory Structure
- **`app/`**: Contains the main application logic.
  - `layout.tsx`: Root layout with font configurations and global styles.
  - `page.tsx`: The main entry page, currently displaying "NirmaanSetu".
  - `globals.css`: Tailwind CSS imports and global styles.
- **`public/`**: Intended for static assets (e.g., images, icons).
- **`src/`**: Present in the root but currently empty.
- **Configuration Files**:
  - `next.config.ts`: Next.js configuration.
  - `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration.
  - `eslint.config.mjs`: Linting rules.
  - `postcss.config.mjs`: PostCSS configuration for Tailwind.
  - `package.json`: Project metadata, scripts, and dependencies.

## Current State
The application is in its initial boilerplate state with a single "NirmaanSetu" heading centered on the home page.
